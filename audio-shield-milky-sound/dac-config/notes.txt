Play what is on the sram
	Using "Commande SPI" panel 
	Send 0x00.

Upload a song to the sram

	1) Using the "Charger un fichier WAV" panel
		Simply choose a wav file smaller than 512Ko (ram size) then click on the "Envoyer" button.

	2) Using "Commande SPI" panel
		You might want to upload a known set of values for debugging purpose,
		start your set by 0x40 then put a space between each bytes.
		It is recommended to put a multiple of 4 bytes to avoid changes in the sequence.
		exemple: 0x40 32 65 12 45 32 50 45 21
		
Configure the DAC

	1) Using the "Charger un fichier de configuration pour le DAC" panel
		You need to have previously updated the flash memory and the firmware with an image 
		that contains and allows this option.

		Simply copy/paste the configuration up to the waiting point (read the comment to know where to stop)
		Then click the "Envoyer" button. 
		Do the same things with the second part of the configuration.
		A "beep" shall be audible if the configuration went well.

	2) To send a single command or to read a register from the DAC
		go to the "Commande SPI" section of the embedded interface.

		Begin all communication by : 0xC0

		0x mean that you are sending a hexadecimal command 
		C0 tells the FPGA that it is an I2C command

		You MUST wait 1 second between 2 commands or the FPGA will send C0 as the address Byte

		a write command is shown a this in "config SPI.txt" : w 30 50 80

		30 : 0011000 is the device address and the last bit is the "WRITE" bit
		50 is the hexadecimal number of the register that will get written
		80 means to write 1 to the 7th bit and 0 to all the other bits of the register


		a read command looks like this : 31 47

		30 : 0011000 is the device address and the last bit is the "READ" bit
		47 is the hexadecimal number of the register that will get read
