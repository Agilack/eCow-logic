To configure the dac, go to the "Commande SPI" section of the embedded interface.

Begin all communication by : 0xC0

0x means that you are sending a hexadecimal command 
C0 tells the FPGA that it is an I2C command

You MUST wait 1 second between 2 commands or the FPGA will send C0 as the address Byte

a write command is shown a this in "config SPI.txt" : w 30 50 80

30 : 0011000 is the device address and the last bit is the "WRITE" bit
50 is the hexadecimal number of the register that will get written
80 means to write 1 to the 7th bit and 0 to all the other bits of the register

Example of write command : 0xC0 30 25 03

a read command looks like this : 31 47

30 : 0011000 is the device address and the last bit is the "READ" bit
47 is the hexadecimal number of the register that will get read

Example of read command : 0xC0 31 25
