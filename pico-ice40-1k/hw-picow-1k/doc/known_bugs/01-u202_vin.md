Bad U202 input
==============

The 1V2 switching regulator is connected to 3V3. The minimal input for
this component is 4.5V so, never start.

This is also a bad choice because if two regs are cascaded this increase
current in 3V3 and reduce performance.

Proposed fix
------------

The input of U202 can be connected to main supply.
