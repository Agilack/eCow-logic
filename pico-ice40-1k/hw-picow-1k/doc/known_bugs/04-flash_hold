Flash memory stay "Hold"
========================

  The hold signal of the flash memory is not driven. This works with some
component ... and not with other.

Proposed fix
------------

  A small pull-up resistor must be added between VCC and hold.

  For the r01 prototype, this pin can simply be connected to VCC (pin 8)
with a wire.
